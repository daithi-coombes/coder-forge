<p>Welcome to the coder forge.</p>
<p>These events hope to provide a place for adults to learn and trade as a
`coder`. They are open to all, from complete newbies (noobs) to advanced
programmers (guru's).</p>

<p>There is no set curriculum and no costs either. Because of this these weekly
meetups will be on an open door basis.</p>

<p>As you can see this site is a work in progress, as is the project on a whole,
but please do drop into our next <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Coder-Forge/events/227966239/">meetup</a> and see what it is all about.</p>
